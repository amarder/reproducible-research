This is an adaptation of Karl Broman's [Tools for Reproducible Research](https://github.com/kbroman/Tools4RR).

A minimal standard for data analysis and other scientific computations is that they be reproducible: that the code and data are assembled in a way so that another group can re-create all of the results (e.g., the figures in a paper). The importance of such reproducibility is now widely recognized, but it is still not so widely practiced as it should be, in large part because many computational scientists (and particularly statisticians) have not fully adopted the required tools for reproducible research.

In this course, we will discuss general principles for reproducible research but will focus primarily on the use of relevant tools (particularly [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), [git](https://git-scm.org/), and [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/)), with the goal that the students leave the course ready and willing to ensure that all aspects of their computational research (software, data analyses, papers, presentations, posters) are reproducible.

Project: There will be one small project, developed over the course of the semester:

* Implement something in R (e.g., simulation + fancy plot).
* Develop it in a git repository on github or bitbucket.
* Make it an R package.
* Use knitr to make a vignette.
* Use testthat to include a unit test.
* Make sure it passes R CMD check.

* The source for the website
* The source for other material (e.g., lecture slides)
